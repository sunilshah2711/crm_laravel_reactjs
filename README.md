# This is an CRM project.
In this CRM project, we built the backend in Laravel and the frontend in ReactJS.

## In the Backend
We established servel tabels in airtable, such as deals, contacts, partners, and so on, and we utilise those airtable for api.
In Laravel, we only created the login module.

## In the frontend
we constructed a kanban board for deals, contacts, and partners, and filtered their data using the left side of the server filters.
